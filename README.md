## Usage
Right now, the package is not published anywhere, as its not completely usable.
You can import it from this Raw GitHub URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/discord-deno/discord.deno/main/mod.ts

For a quick example, run this:
```bash
deno run --allow-net https://raw.githubusercontent.com/discord-deno/discord.deno/main/examples/ping.ts
```
And input your bot's token and Intents.

Here is a small example of how to use discord.deno,
```ts
import { Client, Message, Intents } from 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/discord-deno/discord.deno/main/mod.ts'

const client = new Client()

client.on('ready', () => {
  console.log(`Ready! User: ${client.user?.tag}`)
})

client.on('messageCreate', (msg: Message): void => {
  if (msg.content === '!ping') {
    msg.channel.send(`Pong! WS Ping: ${client.ping}`)
  }
})

// Replace with your bot's token and intents (Intents.All, Intents.Presence, Intents.GuildMembers)
client.connect('super secret token comes here', Intents.All)
```
